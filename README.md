# Stockton Coding Assignments
I've compiled most of the Java and Python programming assignments that I've competed at Stockton University. I started this project with the hopes of introducing incoming students to what Stockton computer science course work looks like.

### Stockton Courses in this Repository
:file_folder: **CSCI_2101** Programming & Problem Solving I
Java Language, Eclipse IDE

:file_folder: **CSCI_2102** Programming & Problem Solving II
Java Language, Eclipse IDE

:file_folder: **CSCI_3103** Data Structures & Algorithms I
Java Language, Eclipse IDE

:file_folder: **CSCI_4101** Data Structures & Algorithms II
Python Language, Visual Studio Code IDE

:file_folder: **CSCI_4481** Cryptography & Data Security
Python Language, Visual Studio Code IDE

## How to Run 
Download the a zip of the repo or run `git clone https://github.com/SatherWS/Stockton_Coding_Assignments.git`

If you only want to download a single course folder from this repository you can use svn. For example if you only want to download the course files from Programming & Problem Solving I you can run the command below.

`svn checkout https://github.com/SatherWS/Stockton_Coding_Assignments/trunk/CSCI_2101`

To install a different folder you would need to replace the end of the URL string with the desired folder name.

**SVN Installation**

Windows: `choco install svn`

Linux (Debian Based): `sudo apt-get install subversion`

### Running Projects in Eclipse IDE
In my opinion its best to use Eclipse IDE. It's not required but, the professors use it to grade Java assignments.

When you run Eclipse IDE be sure to set your workspace to the path to one of the folders below.
* CSCI_2101
* CSCI_2102
* CSCI_3103

To switch workspaces you can select file > switch workspace. You are then left to your own devices to figure out how to execute each project.

### Running Projects in VS Code (or any Python IDE)
This process is pretty straight forward, you can find many solutions online as well. Project folders written in Python are listed below.
* CSCI_4101
* CSCI_4481


## Academic Policies
**Disclaimer:** Submitting the my solutions as your own will not benefit you for the following reasons.

1. Most academic dishonesty policies result in immediate expulsion.
2. If you do not understand the concepts covered in the code you will fail programming exams.
3. The solutions in this repository are not 100% correct.
